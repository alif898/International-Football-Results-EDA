# International-Football-Results-EDA-R
I came across some datasets on Kaggle relating to football and as a fan of the sport, decided to use these datasets to practice and learn R.

### Conclusion
Overall, when analysing historical performances, looking at all-time wins or win percentage yields no surprises. But breaking it down on a decade by decade basis reveals some interesting findings, such as tiny island Tahiti having the highest win-percentage for 2 consecutive decades (1970-1990).

GDP and population also have a statistically significant relationship with performance, although it is clear there are many other factors that we have yet to explore and account for.
